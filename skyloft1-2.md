# Skyloft Update
### Version Beta 1.2 - Combat and Cobalt

Update 1.2, Combat and Cobalt, brings lots more to the game. Read on!

**Update 1.2**

- **The Combat System has been upgraded!** Skyloft's Combat system has recieved a much-needed overhaul. Instead of card-like turn by turn moves, it's now free for all! You don't need to take turns, instead go crazy on the attack button and hope you survive.

- **Cobalt has been added.** Cobalt, a new mineral found under the Skyloft, has proven to be useful. Wire up contraptions to use in battle, and when you're building you have a temporary forcefield!

- **More smaller updates...**

  - You can no longer attack enemies in the Elemental Loft while in the blacksmith's store.
  
  - A new wish, "Demolish All Babies", has been updated to the prayer list.
  
  - The large, unnecessary Fortnite logo has been removed from the Skybox.
  
  - You can no longer use a single swipe of a pocket knife to murder an entire family.
  
  - You can no longer fly after cutting your own wings off.
